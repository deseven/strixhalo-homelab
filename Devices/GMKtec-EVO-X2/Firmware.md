# GMKtec EVO-X2 Firmware

BIOS and EC firmware are available [on the GMKtec website](https://www.gmktec.com/pages/drivers-and-software), but since they update it rarely and put them on Google Drive, you can download them here as well.

### BIOS & EC upgrade
All devices sent after the middle of May seem to have BIOS version of at least 1.04. The only officially supported upgrade way is using Windows, follow the included instructions. Something like [Hiren's BootCD](https://www.hirensbootcd.org) could be used as a more convenient option. You're supposed to update EC firware first and BIOS the last.
