# GMKtec EVO-X2 Firmware

::: info
If you happen to have BIOS or EC firmware versions not presented on this page and would like to share, please **[contact me directly](https://d7.wtf/contact)** or **[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/pnPRyucNrG)**
:::

BIOS and EC firmware are available [on the GMKtec website](https://www.gmktec.com/pages/drivers-and-software), but since they update it rarely and put them on Google Drive, you can download them here as well.

### BIOS & EC upgrade
All devices sent after the middle of May seem to have BIOS version of at least 1.04. The only officially supported upgrade way is using Windows, follow the included instructions. Something like [Hiren's BootCD](https://www.hirensbootcd.org) could be used as a more convenient option. You're supposed to update EC firware first and BIOS the last.

> [!WARNING]
> The officially released versions are BIOS 1.04 and EC 1.04. The newer versions seem to be perfectly stable for me, but use them at your own risk.
