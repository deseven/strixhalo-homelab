## Strix Halo HomeLab

![Strix Halo APU](./strix-halo.jpg)

**Welcome to the Strix Halo HomeLab wiki!**

The purpose of this website is to gather all important information related to systems with AMD Ryzen AI MAX and MAX+ in home lab applications, so most of the [[guides|Guides]] are very Linux-centric, but there is also a list of [[Strix Halo devices|Devices]] (PCs only) I try to maintain.

My personal use case is the following:
 - AI MAX+ 395 with 128G of RAM
 - VRAM allocation is 64G
 - Proxmox as the host system
 - Windows VM with iGPU passed through, for gaming and LLMs
 - Linux VMs for NAS and other services

If you have something to say or want to participate, feel free to [contact me](https://d7.wtf/contact) directly or join the Discord server.
