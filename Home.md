## Strix Halo HomeLab

![](./strix-halo.jpg)

Welcome to the Strix Halo HomeLab wiki!

The purpose of this website is to gather all important information related to systems with AMD Ryzen AI MAX and MAX+ in home lab applications, so most of the [[guides|Guides]] are very Linux-centric, but there is also a list of [[Strix Halo devices|Devices]] (PCs only) I try to maintain.

If you have something to say or want to participate, feel free to [contact me](https://d7.wtf/contact).
